The images of My Free Textures are distributed as royalty free with the only exception being the right to use photos from this website to create a similar or competing service, like a stock photography platform.

Fair Use – You can use the images with credit / attribution to www.myfreetextures.com. Sometimes it is not possible to give credit directly on a final project – in these cases please mention the site on your website, Facebook or similar, whatever you think is fair.

You May

 Download the images on this site
 Use them for both commercial and/or personal use
 Modify, Photoshop, or change them, delete them :)
 Make new products that you sell or give away
 Use them as background for your website, game etc
You May Not

 Claim that you are the owner or copyright holder
 Upload them to stock and/or photo sharing sites and platforms or distribute them without modification
 Include them in texture packs or collages of textures for download
Resizing: Not a must do, just advice :) If you are using the image on the internet, re-size it down to the smallest size you need. If it is the background you don’t want to use a 4000 x 4000 pixel, 9mb image as your background as it will wipe out your bandwidth and be very slow loading! make it smaller :)

Linking:  please link to the page and not direct to the image – that way people can have a nice look around before downloading :).

Hotlinking: Please do not link direct to the image so that it loads from my server (I got kicked of my first server because of excessive bandwidth usage because so many people were doing this. Over 80% of my bandwidth usage was people doing this :(

 

Enjoy! I love seeing what people have done with them feel free to drop me a message using the contact form or in the comments!"
